have you written unit tets for a function returing void? 
There can be function which just print to console some messages under different situations.
So in unit test we can check that situation by reading console and checking the expected message.
But reading a console is not possible; another way is re directing console to a file and check the file for message.
Recently i wrote a simple class to re direct console to a file and can reset back to screen after the use.
here I am sharing it
